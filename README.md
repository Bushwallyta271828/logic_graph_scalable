Deployment process: (this should eventually be part of a CI/CD pipeline, but right now let's just do it manually)

* Open AWS Lightsail, go to Containers, and select the container service (or create a new one).
* Create an initial deployment or modify an existing deployment
* Paste in the link to the Docker image (with the correct commit tag!) from the GitHub Container Registry.
* Create environment variables with COME BACK COME BACK COME BACK
